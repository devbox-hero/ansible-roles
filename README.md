# VSCode DevBox

Note: This is very much work in progress but the goal of this is to be able to easily spin up a VSCode instance and connect to it so you can dev remotely.

Inside cloudinit there are some roles that run.

It installs:
 * zsh
 * chrome
 * vnc
 * docker
 * elixir
 * golang
 * vscode
 * scm_breeze
